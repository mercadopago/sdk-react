## Intro

Wallet Brick allows you to offer payments from your Mercado Pago account at any stage of the purchase process. This Brick can be implemented through a direct and customized integration that allows: fast payments, safe environment and increase in payment approval rate.

---

## How it works

This is like a wrapper for the Brick. It breaks the main characteristics - initialization, customizations and callbacks - in _props_ for the component. In this way, it is possible to minimize the impact if the Bricks change and take advantage of the already existent documentation.

---

## How to use

```ts
import Wallet, { initMercadoPago } from '@mercadopago/sdk-react';

initMercadoPago('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');

const Example = () => {
  return <Wallet initialization={{ preferenceId: '<PREFERENCE_ID>' }} />;
};

export default Example;
```
