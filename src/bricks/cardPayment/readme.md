## Intro

Card Payment Brick is a component for your checkout made by MercadoPago. This implementation intents to help React developers to use this brick even faster then using the JS SDK directly.

---

## How it works

This is like a wrapper for the Brick. It breaks the main characteristics - initialization, customizations and callbacks - in _props_ for the component. In this way, it is possible to minimize the impact if the Bricks change and take advantage of the already existent documentation.

---

## How to use

```ts
import CardPayment, { initMercadoPago } from '@mercadopago/sdk-react';

initMercadoPago('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');

const Example = () => {
  return <CardPayment initialization={{ amount: AMOUNT }} onSubmit={} />;
};

export default Example;
```
